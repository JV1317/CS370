## Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science 

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
<p>Treasure hunt game is a pathfinding problem where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. For this project I was provided starter code and a sample environment where the pirate agent was placed. The objective was to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the agent to find the most efficient way to the end point.</p>

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
<p>Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze technology-based solutions, such as software and hardware, used to solve problems from industries across the board. In today’s world both businesses and individuals depend on this technology for their everyday lives. As technology grows and becomes more prevalent this work becomes more important. Computer scientists ensure the design, development and implementation of these solutions are sound and will not fail when people depend on them the most. Also, with technologies advancing at such a rapid pace computer scientists are the first line of defense to ensuring that the ethical responsibilities of these solutions are followed. Computer scientists work to further the field and to provide new and exciting solutions to more complex problems in a responsible way.</p>

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
<p>As a computer scientist when solving problems using computer-based solutions it is important to be exact and attempt to fully understand the customers’ needs and the full purpose of the solution so that I can fully incorporate and deliver all aspects that they are required for this solution. This means examining the solution from all points of view such as the developer, system admin, end user etc. </p>

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
<p>Ethical responsibilities to the end user include providing solutions that will not violate the end user’s rights to privacy and safety. This includes providing solutions that ensure data protection on information such as personal correspondence, banking information, location, etc. 
  
Ethical responsibilities to the organization also include providing solutions that provide data protection for both the organization’s end users and for the organization itself. Keeping proprietary information protected is the responsibility of every employee of that organization and solutions need to be developed in a way to protect this information as well as the information of the end user. It is also the ethical responsibility of every computer scientist to consider the implementation and use of solutions and should not take part in solutions that are intended to cause harm.
