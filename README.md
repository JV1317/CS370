## Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science 

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
<p> Treasure hunt game is a pathfinding problem where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. For this project I was provided starter code and a sample environment where the pirate agent was placed. The objective was to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the agent to find the most effiecient way to the end point. </p>
